Take note that the rental is a convertible, which means there's enough room to create an extra room/privacy for someone else or for just added privacy. The apt has onsite laundry. You might never need it with New York's abundant order-in options, but the kitchen features granite countertops and hardwood floors. You'll find an electric oven. The bedroom has hardwood flooring.

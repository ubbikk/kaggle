It's a perfect interactive blend of the Chris Nolan movies and Batman the Animated Series (2004-2008).Concept:  10/10!!!Hugo Strange has taken over an isolated part of Gotham City and turned it into a giant free range prison.  Unfortunately, Bruce Wayne is trapped inside with the world's most notorious villains.  But once he gets to his gear, he's BATMAN!  And that's a good thing because it means YOU'RE BATMAN!  In Arkham City, you can go anywhere, fight thugs, perform side quests, search for Riddler Clues, or continue with the main story at your own pace.  It's a Strong Candidate for Game of the Year.Story:  10/10In Arkham City, the Joker injects Batman with his own blood.  Aside from being really disturbing, Joker's blood contains a deadly virus.  Batman must infiltrate the territories of Two Face, the Penguin, the Joker, and many others to find a cure.  I don't want to spoil anything here, but this game is loaded with many of the Best Batman Characters of all time.Gameplay:  8/10There are five basic types of gameplay:  Combat, Stealth, Riddler Clues, Boss Battles, and Detective WorkThe Combat functions as it did before, but now there are more gadgets to unlock and more enemy types to battle.  There's a counter attack button, an attack button, an evade button, and a stun button.  Typically, you point in the direction of the enemy and press the attack button and Batman will perform the best fighting animation based on angle and distance.  The same is true with counter attacks.  Attacking enemies will have an icon above their heads when you can counter them.  If you press the button at the right time, Batman negates their attack and attacks them.  In a typical encounter, Batman fights about 4-20 enemies and if you're good, you can stand right in the middle of them and take them out with ease, because that's what Batman would do.Advanced Combat deals with gadgets.  During combat you can activate Batarangs, a Grappling Hook, Ice Bombs, Detonation Mines, or an Electrical Charge.  If you start to lose the fight, you can usually grapple hook out of there and escape.  Basically, as you are fighting, you want to dish out as much damage to enemies as possible, while countering their attacks.  After a while, you'll get really good at this and you'll have some great looking fights while feeling like Batman.The only downside to combat is that there are special enemies who you have to attack by pressing Evade, Evade, Attack, or Stun, Evade, Evade...  And it gets hard to remember what you have to do.  The game would have been much better if the function of the buttons never changed and some enemies were resistant to one attack or significantly more dangerous than the others.  If a special enemy hits you a few times, text appears telling you how to hit him.  At this point, you feel less like Batman.The Stealth Gameplay is very user friendly and much less punishing than other games.  Remember Metal Gear and Splinter Cell?  If a guy saw you, you had to play the last 15 minutes over?  Not here.  When Batman encounters enemies with guns, stealth helps out quite a bit, but it is not necessary.  There are gadgets to distract enemies (Sonic batarang), gadgets to incapacitate enemies (explosive gel), gadgets to render their guns useless (disruptor), environmental props that help you and hurt them (breakable walls, floors, ceilings, generators, floor grates...) And even if they see you, you can still fight your way out of it with a smoke bomb or special attack moves (disarm).  Batman can also see enemies through walls and plan a strategy to take them out.  You are not punished for not using stealth, it just helps.  If you play the game right and use your environment, the guards don't stand a chance... because you're Batman!There are 440 Riddler Clues and Challenges in the game that unlock arena battles, arena stealth games, concept art, trophies, Riddler Side Quests, etc...  They are scattered throughout the city.  Some you just need to find, while others require a puzzle.  To be perfectly honest... there are WAAAY TOO MANY!  I've gotten about 120 of these so far, and I am starting to hate video games.  To get some Achievements, you have to:  Find the clues on the map, solve the puzzle to get the clue, unlock a mini-game, play the mini-game in ranked mode and do awesome on it...  It's too much.  Proportionally, 33% of the game is the main quest.  67% of the game are these damn clues.  The good news is that they are optional.  Because you want to be Batman, not the Riddler's B****.The Boss Battles are fun and require you to use combat skills, stealth, or both.  They're very cinematic and satisfying!  And they showcase the awesomeness of Batman!Because Batman is also a detective, there are parts of the game where you use your CSI skills to track down an enemy.  These are pretty simple, yet rewarding and lead you to other quests.  This is what Batman does.Navigation:  10/10Batman can use his grappling hook to quickly pull himself through Arkham City, or use his cape to quickly glide through areas.  It's really easy and fun to get from one end of the city to another.Graphics:  9/10Arkham City, the characters, the visual effects, all look great.  The game is also playable in 3D mode so you can feel even more like Batman!!!  The areas of Arkham City are very stylized and look like they came right out of a Chris Nolan movie.  The characters are a blend of psychotic and creepy, and Batman looks great.Sound:  9/10The music is suspenseful, epic, and exciting.  The voice acting well cast and well acted!  The dialogue is funny / creepy.  The FX punctuate the action!Maturity:  TIt's a violent graphic novel come to life... or an interactive Batman Movie.  There's violence, blood, and insane villains.  Mild Language because this is a city full of criminals, but it's not like a Quentin Tarantino film.Replay Value:  6/10After you finish the game, there are the Riddler Challenge Arenas, a Hard Mode, Downloadable Content, and a Super Hard Mode where the combat is tougher and there are no visual indicators over the bad guys' heads.  The only problem with the replay is that the combat lacks depth and starts to feel repetitive if you do all of the extras.  The main campaign is about 10 hours long, 14 with the side quests.  If you do the Riddler Challenges, that could be another 12 hours.  That's another 12 hours of fighting, without any new story elements, gear, enemies...  The gameplay starts to feel like a grind at that point.Overall:  9.5/10This is a GREAT Action Game!!!  The graphics, story, and sound create the perfect atmosphere for a Batman Game.  The gameplay is easy to learn, forgiving, and fun.  It does get a bit stale if you play all of the extras though.Buy it if you want to be Batman!Buy it if you love Batman!Buy it if you loved Arkham Asylum and wanted a bigger, better version of it!Buy it if you love sandbox games.Rent it if you have about 12-14 hours to blow through the campaign and side quests.Avoid it if you really need deep combo juggle combat like Ninja Gaiden or Bayonetta.Avoid it if you don't like dark stories.", "previous": {"status": "ok", "entities": [{"mentionsCount": 5, "type": "Entity", "name": "Arkham City", "sentiment": {"positive":

Not this one. The kid knew what he was doing from square one and, even though he couldn't (and never really did) get the Hendrix aspirations out of his system, you'll forgive him because he's playing here as though there really is a hellhound on his trail. And it yanks his rhythm section along for a ride comparable to a starving dog attacking a lamb roast. By the time Stevie Ray and the boys get finished, there's not a strand of meat left over.He can't resist letting flash override substance here and there (I mean, let's quit kidding ourselves: he wasn't exactly allergic to letting the show take over for awhile, his most wounding flaw), but there is no question but that this kid meant it from end to end. Stevie Ray Vaughan may not have started the great late 1970s-early 1980s blues revival, but without question he made the most of it. Don't let the absence of his soon-to-be-familiar crowdpleasers throw you, either.

The gameplay does a good job of having you feel like you're in an exciting episode of the show.The characters and voices are right from the TV show, so you really feel like you're part of the action. You head out to the crime scene - a woman was killed while jogging in Central Park. You search the scene for evidence, and then start talking to various suspects.You can choose your strengths, so you can know which questions not to ask, or you can get help finding evidence by having them highlighted. You have your crime lab and research lab examine evidence, and your surveillance team watches the people. As you find more clues, you track down more people to talk to. Get enough evidence, and you can request a search warrant, and eventually accuse someone of the crime.That's when things get turned over to the lawyers. Now you try to prosecute this criminal, calling witnesses, discussing evidence, objecting to bad questioning. If you do a good enough job, you can nail the perpetrator!The game definitely draws you along, You eagerly await the results of the tests you request, and wonder what the people you are talking to are hiding. You have an inkling of what you are looking for, and dig around until you track it down.On the downside, the game is extremely single-threaded. The only way you can talk to person X is to investigate item Y - but you have no idea that it's item Y you need to submit out of the 50+ items you find at the scene. You can't carry them all, and you get scolded for picking up each item or submitting too many to evaluate. Where in a normal crime scene you'd figure the crew would gather up all evidence and sift it for you, here you get deducted moments for each &quot;thing&quot; on the ground (you don't know what it is until you pick it up) you even look at! So it almost forces you to play each half of the game many times - a few times to figure out what all the items *are* and which are important, and then a last time to actually just touch the items you now know &quot;by osmosis&quot; are important to your case.The same is true during questioning of various people - questions that seem to be quite related end up causing the person not to answer questions that you actually need. They randomly decide at a point not to talk to you further - even if you have more questions for them. For example, a cleaner has his cart parked on a key point of evidence. But ask him the wrong questions and you cannot ask him to move his cart, even though he's still standing right there!Finally, even though I use my system for many, many games of all types, this one crashed on me very frequently. It just meant even more frequent saves and restores, beyond what the gameplay already forced on you through its single-mindedness.Recommended to a fan of the show, and a great concept. Hopefully future releases will address some of these issues and give the game more open gameplay, as in real world detecting.", "previous": {"status": "ok", "entities": [{"mentionsCount": 1, "type": "Location", "name": "Central Park", "sentiment": {"positive": 0.0, "neutral": 1.0, "negative": 0.0}, "aliases": []}, {"mentionsCount": 1, "type": "Entity", "name": "X", "sentiment": {"positive": 0.0, "neutral": 0.641025641025641, "negative": 0.358974358974359}, "aliases": []}, {"mentionsCount": 1, "type": "Entity", "name": "Hopefully", "sentiment": {"positive": 0.45454545454545453, "neutral": 0.5454545454545454, "negative": 0.0}, "aliases": []}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.24193548387096775, "neutral": 0.3709677419354839, "negative": 0.3870967741935484}}}, "amazon_video_games__AG35H9HPV2R99__1374019200": {"current": {"status": "ok", "entities": [{"mentionsCount": 1, "type": "Location", "name": "DC", "sentiment": {"positive": 0.0, "neutral": 1.0, "negative": 0.0}, "aliases": []}, {"mentionsCount": 2, "type": "Entity", "name": "Ehhhhhhhhhh", "sentiment": {"positive": 0.0, "neutral": 0.33333333333333337, "negative": 0.6666666666666666}, "aliases": []}, {"mentionsCount": 4, "type": "Entity", "name": "Genesis", "sentiment": {"positive": 0.0, "neutral": 0.33333333333333337, "negative": 0.6666666666666666}, "aliases": []}, {"mentionsCount": 1, "type": "Organization", "name": "Master System", "sentiment": {"positive": 0.0, "neutral": 0.33333333333333337, "negative": 0.6666666666666666}, "aliases": []}, {"mentionsCount": 1, "type": "Entity", "name": "Virtua Cop", "sentiment": {"positive": 0.0, "neutral": 1.0, "negative": 0.0}, "aliases": []}, {"mentionsCount": 1, "type": "Entity", "name": "Sega Saturn", "sentiment": {"positive": 0.21951219512195122, "neutral": 0.7804878048780488, "negative": 0.0}, "aliases": []}, {"mentionsCount": 4, "type": "Entity", "name": "Sega Swirl", "sentiment": {"positive": 0.0, "neutral": 0.9636363636363636, "negative": 0.03636363636363636}, "aliases": []}, {"mentionsCount": 2, "type": "Entity", "name": "Dreamcast", "sentiment": {"positive": 0.0, "neutral": 0.5609756097560976, "negative": 0.43902439024390244}, "aliases": []}, {"mentionsCount": 1, "type": "Entity", "name": "Sega", "sentiment": {"positive": 0.0, "neutral": 1.0, "negative": 0.0}, "aliases": []}, {"mentionsCount": 1, "type": "Entity", "name": "Sonic", "sentiment": {"positive": 0.0, "neutral": 1.0, "negative": 0.0}, "aliases": []}], "sentiment": {"positive": 0.08284023668639054, "neutral": 0.47928994082840237, "negative": 0.4378698224852071}}, "text": "Ehhhhhhhh...

It is loads of fun and fairly lengthy. It will satisfy any fan of Wolverine and is definitely worth playing or owning. The camera can be a little loose, but you get by. Also, some of the pacing is bad in that some levels can get very long and hard, and if you die you have to start at the beginning. It can get bothersome, but it only happens on the stealth levels: once or twice. The implementation of Wolverine's senses has been captured perfectly. When you go into sense mode, everything becomes orange, allowing Wolverine to see the green scent trails of enemies in rooms, hidden threats (landmines, laser beams), footsteps of soldiers, and points where you can pull off stealth moves on an enemy. While on the topic of stealth attacks, you can sneak up on soldiers in sense-mode, push X, and pull off a cool stealth move in order to grab the enemy's dog tags. The battle system is a bit bland, but since the controls are fairly smooth, it's still fun. Also, you can pull off melee strike attacks, with which you can down multiple enemies at once. There are several boss battles- all very fun- and a plausible story written by Marvel/Wolverine scribe Larry Hama. Several costumes are also hidden in the game, so you can play as any generation's Wolverine. The costumes include New X-Men, classic Yellow and Blue, classic Brown and Yellow, Patch, and X2 Movie.

However, some traders believe these figures are\n  overstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, the\n  bulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also off\n  the market in futures stores.\n      A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been\n  sold for export or to the home market since the season started\n  July 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59\n  mln tonnes.\n      Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln\n  tonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said.\n      This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed all\n  early expectations and has created the present nervous\n  situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market\n  supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in\n  August.\n      The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total\n  barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a new\n  record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes\n  achieved in the 1984/85 season.\n      Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and\n  barley around 4.50 mln tonnes.\n      The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln\n  tonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28\n  mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traders\n  said.\n      Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British\n  grain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mln\n  tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compares\n  with 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season.\n      The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to stay\n  buoyant for the remaining few months of the season.
